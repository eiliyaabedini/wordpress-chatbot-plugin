# Chatbot Plugin Development Summary

## Project Overview
This is a WordPress plugin that enables a chat system between website visitors and administrators. The plugin adds a chat widget to the frontend and an admin interface to manage and respond to conversations, with AI-powered analytics capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Frontend Chat Widget**: Users can start conversations by entering their name
- **Real-time Updates**: Messages are updated via polling mechanism
- **Persistent Conversations**: Conversations are stored and can be resumed
- **Admin Interface**: Admins can view and respond to conversations
- **Database Storage**: All conversations and messages are stored in the database
- **AI Analytics**: OpenAI-powered analysis of conversation data with interactive follow-up questions
- **Custom Chatbot Configuration**: Multiple chatbots with different knowledge bases and personas

## Implementation Details

### Database Structure
Several custom tables were created:
- `wp_chatbot_conversations`: Stores conversation metadata (visitor name, creation time, active status)
- `wp_chatbot_messages`: Stores individual messages (sender type, message content, timestamp)
- `wp_chatbot_analytics_events`: Tracks user interactions and events
- `wp_chatbot_analytics_api_usage`: Monitors API usage and costs
- `wp_chatbot_analytics_insights`: Stores AI-generated insights
- `wp_chatbot_analytics_metrics`: Tracks daily usage metrics
